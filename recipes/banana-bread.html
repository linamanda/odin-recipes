    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>
        Banana bread is one of the most classic sweet treats. Sweetened and 
        moistened with overripe bananas, this dessert gives the allure of a 
        slightly healthier version of a loaf cake. Dense, but tender, soft, 
        and moist - it's sure to be a treat whether you're looking for a last 
        minute quick bake to bring to a get-together, or if you're looking to 
        savor it all yourself!
    </p>
    <p>
        This exact recipe comes from the JustOneCookbook blog. It is a recipe 
        that has been tried a countless number of times. If you're looking for 
        a gluten-free version, this recipe has proven to be just as good! All 
        you need to do is replace the recipe's flour with a 1-to-1 gluten-free 
        flour.

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>200 g all-purpose flour</li>
        <li>0.5 tsp kosher salt</li>
        <li>0.5 tsp baking soda</li>
        <li>0.5 tsp baking powder</li>
        <li>113 g unsalted butter (softened to room temperature)</li>
        <li>100g sugar</li>
        <li>2 large eggs (at room temperature)</li>
        <li>1 tbsp neutral oil</li>
        <li>1 tsp pure vanilla extract</li>
        <li>3 ripe bananas</li>
        <li>30 g raisins (optional)</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Gather all the ingredients. The eggs must be at room temperature.</li>
        <li>Preheat the oven to 350째F (180째C). Line a loaf baking pan with 
            parchment paper.</li>
        <li>In a fine-mesh sieve (or sifter) over a bowl, combine 200 g 
            all-purpose flour (plain flour), 0.5 tsp baking soda, 0.5 tsp 
            baking powder, 0.5 tsp Diamond Crystal kosher salt, and sift all 
            together.</li>
        <li>In the bowl of a stand mixer, beat 113 g unsalted butter 
            (softened) until creamy.</li>
        <li>Add 100 g sugar and whisk until well blended, fluffy, and pale yellow.</li>
        <li>Add 2 large eggs (50 g each w/o shell) and beat well.</li>
        <li>Using a silicone spatula, scrape the sides and bottom of the bowl 
            and continue beating.</li>
        <li>Add 1 Tbsp neutral oil and 1 tsp pure vanilla extract. Beat until 
            well blended.</li>
        <li>Mash 3 ripe bananas and stir to blend with the egg mixture.</li>
        <li>Add the flour mixture to the banana mixture and stir just until 
            80% blended. Add 80 g raisins at this stage, if you'd like to 
            include them, and blend for 3 seconds.</li>
        <li>While the white specs of flour are still visible, remove the 
            mixing bowl from the stand mixer. Using the silicone spatula, 
            hand-blend the rest of the flour. This will avoid overmixing the 
            batter.</li>
        <li>Pour the batter into the prepared pan, spreading it evenly with 
            the silicone spatula.</li>
        <li>Bake at 350째F (180째C) until a toothpick inserted into the center 
            of the bread comes out clean, about 50-60 minutes.</li>
        <li>Take out the baking pan from the oven and let cool for 45-60 minutes.
            Remove the banana bread from the baking pan.</li>
    </ol>

    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>
        Oatmeal raisin cookies are a classic cookie flavor right next to the 
        all-time favorite chocolate chip cookies. They are full of warm 
        flavors blended together with rich sweetness from both brown sugar 
        and raisins. They are a true comfort!
    </p>

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>2 cups all-purpose flour</li>
        <li>1 tsp baking soda</li>
        <li>1 tsp baking powder</li>
        <li>1 tsp kosher salt</li>
        <li>1 cup unsalted butter, softened</li>
        <li>1 cup sugar</li>
        <li>1 cup dark brown sugar, firmly packed</li>
        <li>2 large eggs</li>
        <li>2 tsp pure vanilla extract</li>
        <li>3 cups rolled oats</li>
        <li>1.5 cups raisins</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Preheat oven to 350Â°.</li>
        <li>Whisk together flour, baking soda, baking powder, and salt. Set 
            aside.</li>
        <li>Combine wet ingredients with a hand mixer on low.</li>
        <li>To cream, increase speed to high and beat until fluffy and the 
            color lightens.</li>
        <li>Stir the flour mixture into the creamed mixture until no flour is 
            visible.</li>
        <li>(Over mixing develops the gluten, making a tough cookie.) Now add 
            the oats and raisins; stir to incorporate.</li>
        <li>Fill a #40 cookie scoop and press against side of bowl, pulling up 
            to level dough (to measure 2 tablespoons of dough).</li>
        <li>Drop 2-inches apart onto baking sheet sprayed with nonstick spray.</li>
        <li>Bake 11-13 minutes (on center rack), until golden, but still moist 
            beneath cracks on top.</li>
        <li>Remove from oven; let cookies sit on baking sheet for 2 minutes 
            before transferring to a wire rack to cool.</li>
    </ol>
